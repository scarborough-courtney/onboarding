Alert NCEAS staff if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress (see Reporting Unacceptable Behavior below).\nRespect the rules and policies of the meeting venue, hotels, NCEAS-contracted facility, or any other venue.\nRespect people’s boundaries.\nBe considerate in your interactions with others and careful about the words you use. Consider if the language that you’re using can be perceived as discriminatory.\nBe mindful of how much time and space you take up. Be aware of the dynamics of power and privilege, and whether you may be taking advantage of it."
