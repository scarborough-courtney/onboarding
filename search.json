Alert NCEAS staff if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress (see Reporting Unacceptable Behavior below).\nRespect the rules and policies of the meeting venue, hotels, NCEAS-contracted facility, or any other venue.\nRespect people’s boundaries.\nBe considerate in your interactions with others and careful about the words you use. Consider if the language that you’re using can be perceived as discriminatory.\nBe mindful of how much time and space you take up. Be aware of the dynamics of power and privilege, and whether you may be taking advantage of it."

    "text": "How NCEAS Responds to Reports\nKnow that NCEAS Leadership Team takes community safety, security, and inclusion seriously and will respond promptly to any reports of unacceptable behavior. The Leadership Team can direct people to all options available through the University of California system to assure that reporting is directed to the appropriate channels and treated with the appropriate level of urgency.\nThe following list of potential sanctions may be taken when violations of the code of conduct are determined to have occurred, depending on the venue and the severity of the violation:\n\nAnyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\nNCEAS staff (or their designee) or security may take any immediate action deemed necessary and appropriate, including removal from a meeting, event, online community (e.g. email lists, community calls, forums, community platforms or software), and future engagement without warning.\nRemoval from the NCEAS public webpage\nEnding a presentation early\nImmediately suspend certain responsibilities and privileges the accused holds\nNotification of the proper authorities\n\nUpon notification of a filed report, NCEAS will follow guidance from the respective law enforcement agency or campus compliance office in its response.\nPrivacy and Confidentiality\nNCEAS will make every effort to maintain the privacy of everyone involved to the degree allowed under law. However, there may be instances when the University’s responsibility to respond to reports of potential discrimination and the rights of the accused (when relevant) outweigh the need for privacy.\nWhile a person’s wish for confidentiality is important, it must be balanced against the University’s responsibility to respond. The University will limit disclosures to what is reasonably necessary to engage in an appropriate response and remedy.\nCampus Confidential Resources\nIf you are unsure as to how to proceed and want to review a detailed inquiry relating to a concern about discrimination while maintaining complete confidentiality, UCSB offers several campus confidential resources that are available to faculty, staff, and students. Any disclosure made to these resources do not put the University on notice, and will not initiate a campus response. These resources can advise you on the available response options and support resources. These resources include:\n\nOffice of the Ombuds: Acts as a confidential resource for the UCSB community to discuss concerns with a trained mediator. They serve faculty, staff, students, parents, or anyone else with a campus‐related concern.\n\n(805) 893‐3285; ombuds.ucsb.edu\n\nAcademic & Staff Assistance Program (ASAP): ASAP counselors promote the emotional health and well‐being of academic personnel, faculty, staff, and eligible family members in a confidential, cost‐free setting.\n\n(805) 893‐3318; hr.ucsb.edu/asap\n\nTitle IX Advocacy Liaison in the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD): RCSGD has a staff member who is designated as a confidential resource for reports of Prohibited Conduct. They serve faculty, staff, and students.\n\n(805) 893‐4284; rcsgd.sa.ucsb.edu\n\n\nPotential Campus Responses to each situation vary from informal responses to formal processes. The responses are determined by the reported conduct, applicable policies, and assessment of the relevant campus stakeholders with bconsideration of the complainant’s preferred response.\nProtection from Retaliation University policy also prohibits retaliation against any employee or applicant who reports a complaint of discrimination or harassment, or who participates in any manner in an investigation or resolution of a complaint."
