title: Remote Work Policy
---

**Purpose/vision**: to create a thriving, inclusive community that learns and embraces the culture and practice of open environmental data science.

**Rationale**: A big part of the experience of being at NCEAS is being part of the community and the immersive experience this offers. Through peer mentoring, serendipitous interactions, and living and breathing open data science, residency at NCEAS regularly offers a transformative experience for people's careers. We put a high priority on building community while building careers.

**Policy**:

-   A resident position is expected to be predominantly in the office. This does not preclude individual arrangements for occasional remote work.

-   The existing criteria for full-time remote work include:

    -   The first three years of a position must be in-residence at NCEAS.

    -   The position has to be one that can be done well remotely.

        -   Does not include supervision of UCSB students

        -   Does not include significant synthesis group interaction

        -   Does not include tasks required to maintain an efficient and welcoming environment for working groups (WG technical support, greeting, food and beverage support).

    -   Supervisor has to say yes.

    -   Any exceptions to these criteria must be approved by the NCEAS Executive Team.

-   Employees who have been working remotely due to COVID19 restrictions and whose position and funding are expected to end within the next 6-9 months do not need to move back to Santa Barbara.

-   Temporary positions (less than 1 year) including interns and fellows may be considered for remote work based on the feasibility of remote work for specific tasks and the consensus of the position's supervisor and team. In such cases, the position will be advertised as having the potential for remote work. NCEAS administrative staff positions are unique at UCSB as they play a key supporting role for in-person working groups. As such, staff positions are expected to be in the office.
