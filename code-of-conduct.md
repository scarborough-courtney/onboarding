title: Code of Conduct
---

The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) values the diversity of views, expertise, opinions, culture, backgrounds, customs, and experiences reflected among NCEAS residents and visitors, and is committed to providing a safe, productive and welcoming environment for everyone in its community. NCEAS can serve as an effective forum to consider and debate sciencerelevant viewpoints in an orderly, respectful, and fair manner. This [Code of Conduct](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nceas.ucsb.edu%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2021-11%2FNCEAS_Code-of-Conduct_Nov2021_0.pdf&clen=214343&chunk=true) is important to promoting diversity and creating an inclusive, supportive, and collaborative environment for all peoples.

The NCEAS code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the NCEAS community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to fostering an inclusive community and expect our code of conduct to be honored by all individuals who engage in NCEAS activities. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be asked to leave the network.

Our Code of Conduct extends to all NCEAS events where individuals' behavior affects the ability of others to participate. This includes all in-person onsite and offsite events as well as virtual events and online interactions (e.g. interacting on Center-related platforms such as Slack, Zoom, email or social media). NCEAS will make efforts to assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe as soon as possible, according to the request of any individual community member.

## Expected  Behavior 

In following this code of conduct, please keep in mind the following expectations about behavior, which are essential for creating a welcoming and safe environment:

-   Treat all participants with kindness, respect and consideration, valuing a diversity of views and opinions (including those you may not share).

-   Communicate openly, with respect for other participants, critiquing ideas rather than individuals.

-   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech directed toward other participants.

-   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert NCEAS staff if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress (see Reporting Unacceptable Behavior below).

-   Respect the rules and policies of the meeting venue, hotels, NCEAS-contracted facility, or any other venue.

-   Respect people's boundaries.

-   Be considerate in your interactions with others and careful about the words you use. Consider if the language that you're using can be perceived as discriminatory.

-   Be mindful of how much time and space you take up. Be aware of the dynamics of power and privilege, and whether you may be taking advantage of it.

## Reporting Unacceptable Behavior

If you are in immediate danger, please call 911 and seek assistance. If you are not in immediate danger but feel that you have experienced unacceptable behavior, have witnessed any such behavior, or have other concerns, please consider the reporting options below and follow the steps you feel most comfortable pursuing.

## How NCEAS Responds to Reports

Know that NCEAS Leadership Team takes community safety, security, and inclusion seriously and will respond promptly to any reports of unacceptable behavior. The Leadership Team can direct people to all options available through the University of California system to assure that reporting is directed to the appropriate channels and treated with the appropriate level of urgency.

The following list of potential sanctions may be taken when violations of the code of conduct are determined to have occurred, depending on the venue and the severity of the violation:

-   Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to
    comply immediately.

-   NCEAS staff (or their designee) or security may take any immediate action deemed necessary and appropriate, including removal from a meeting, event, online community (e.g. email lists, community calls, forums, community platforms or software), and future engagement without warning.

-   Removal from the NCEAS public webpage

-   Ending a presentation early

-   Immediately suspend certain responsibilities and privileges the accused holds

-   Notification of the proper authorities

Upon notification of a
filed report, NCEAS will follow guidance from the respective law enforcement
agency or campus compliance office in its response.

[Privacy and Confidentiality]{.ul}

NCEAS will make every effort to maintain the privacy of everyone involved to the degree allowed under law. However, there may be instances when the University's responsibility to respond to reports of potential discrimination and the rights of the accused (when relevant) outweigh the need for privacy.

While a person's wish for confidentiality is important, it must be balanced against the University's responsibility to respond. The University will limit disclosures to what is reasonably necessary to engage in an appropriate response and remedy.

[Campus Confidential Resources]{.ul}

If you are unsure as to how to proceed and want to review a detailed inquiry relating to a concern about discrimination while maintaining *complete confidentiality*, UCSB offers several campus confidential resources that are available to faculty, staff, and students. Any disclosure made to these resources do not put the University on notice, and will not initiate a campus response. These resources can advise you on the available response options and support resources. These resources include:

-   **Office of the Ombuds:** Acts as a confidential resource for the UCSB community to discuss concerns with a trained mediator. They serve faculty, staff, students, parents, or anyone else with a campus‐related concern.

    -   \(805\) 893‐3285; [ombuds.ucsb.edu](https://ombuds.ucsb.edu/)

-   **Academic & Staff Assistance Program (ASAP):** ASAP counselors promote the emotional health and well‐being of academic personnel, faculty, staff, and eligible family members in a confidential, cost‐free setting.

    -   \(805\) 893‐3318; [hr.ucsb.edu/asap](https://www.hr.ucsb.edu/hr-units/employee-services/asap)

-   **Title IX Advocacy Liaison in the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD):** RCSGD has a staff member who is designated as a confidential resource for reports of Prohibited Conduct. They serve faculty, staff, and students.

    -   \(805\) 893‐4284; [rcsgd.sa.ucsb.edu](https://rcsgd.sa.ucsb.edu/)

**Potential Campus Responses** to each situation vary from informal responses to formal processes. The responses are determined by the reported conduct, applicable policies, and assessment of the relevant campus stakeholders with bconsideration of the complainant's preferred response.

**Protection from Retaliation** University policy also prohibits retaliation against any employee or applicant who reports a complaint of discrimination or harassment, or who participates in any manner in an investigation or resolution of a complaint.
