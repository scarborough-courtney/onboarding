title: Code of Conduct
---

The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) values the diversity of views, expertise, opinions, culture, backgrounds, customs, and experiences reflected among NCEAS residents and visitors, and is committed to providing a safe, productive and welcoming environment for everyone in its community. NCEAS can serve as an effective forum to consider and debate sciencerelevant viewpoints in an orderly, respectful, and fair manner. This [Code of Conduct](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nceas.ucsb.edu%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2021-11%2FNCEAS_Code-of-Conduct_Nov2021_0.pdf&clen=214343&chunk=true) is important to promoting diversity and creating an inclusive, supportive, and collaborative environment for all peoples.

The NCEAS code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the NCEAS community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to fostering an inclusive community and expect our code of conduct to be honored by all individuals who engage in NCEAS activities. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be asked to leave the network.

Our Code of Conduct extends to all NCEAS events where individuals' behavior affects the ability of others to participate. This includes all in-person onsite and offsite events as well as virtual events and online interactions (e.g. interacting on Center-related platforms such as Slack, Zoom, email or social media). NCEAS will make efforts to assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe as soon as possible, according to the request of any individual community member.

## Expected  Behavior 

In following this code of conduct, please keep in mind the following expectations about behavior, which are essential for creating a welcoming and safe environment:

-   Treat all participants with kindness, respect and consideration, valuing a diversity of views and opinions (including those you may not share).

-   Communicate openly, with respect for other participants, critiquing ideas rather than individuals.

-   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech directed toward other participants.

-   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert NCEAS staff if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress (see Reporting Unacceptable Behavior below).

-   Respect the rules and policies of the meeting venue, hotels, NCEAS-contracted facility, or any other venue.

-   Respect people's boundaries.

-   Be considerate in your interactions with others and careful about the words you use. Consider if the language that you're using can be perceived as discriminatory.

-   Be mindful of how much time and space you take up. Be aware of the dynamics of power and privilege, and whether you may be taking advantage of it.

## Reporting Unacceptable Behavior

If you are in immediate danger, please call 911 and seek assistance. If you are not in immediate danger but feel that you have experienced unacceptable behavior, have witnessed any such behavior, or have other concerns, please consider the reporting options below and follow the steps you feel most comfortable pursuing.
