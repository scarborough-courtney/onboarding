-   **Timecards** - Visit our [Timecards Guidance document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A56m-tUY9Cjve1UoxEmGYDj-t84TShxW9PTGlmghDa4/edit) More information on accessing [Kronos](https://www.timekeeping.ucsb.edu/) (our timecard system) and recording your vacation and sick leave time

    -   Am I a Monthly Employee or a Biweekly Employee? - To figure out if you are a monthly or biweekly employee, please check your offer letter. If you have an annual salary, then you are a monthly employee. If you have an hourly rate, then you are a biweekly employee. The **only** exception to this rule is monthly-students, which occurs when a student has multiple appointments, and one of the appointments is a TA-ship.

-   **UC Learning Center** - If you have previously had access to the [UC Learning Center](https://www.learningcenter.ucsb.edu/) and are having trouble now accessing it with your current appointment, please:

    -   Email [info\@learningcenter.ucsb.edu](mailto:info@learningcenter.ucsb.edu) and ask to reactivate your account

    -   Include your full legal name, UCSBNetID, current sponsor department (NCEAS, or department code NCEA), and PI/Manager/Instructor

    -   UCSB Learning Center will then send you more detailed instructions on how to access your account.

-   **UCSB Access Cards** - Please visit <https://ucsbaccesscard.com/> for more information.

-   **UCSB Library Cards** - Visit <https://www.library.ucsb.edu/services/staff> for more information on how to get a library card. Also, please note that you will need a UCSB Access Card to use the library.

-   **Paying for something using grant funding** - If you need to order technical supplies, please contact Thomas Hetmank at [hetmank\@nceas.ucsb.edu](mailto:hetmank@nceas.ucsb.edu).
