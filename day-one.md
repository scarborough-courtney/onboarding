Welcome to NCEAS! We are so excited to have you join our community and hope that the resources here can help you settle in and get acquainted with the people, space, and resources here.

## Before you arrive

All of the introductory emails you received from NCEAS staff members prior to your arrival can be found in our [NCEAS Community](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GnAUmRGTCF1W8sWUuxD2e5SxcjMLljba?usp=sharing) shared Google Drive.

Make sure you visit our [Welcome Website](https://nceaswelcome.weebly.com/) for more information on the NCEAS and UCSB community. There is a ton of really useful and timely tips there to help.

## NCEAS Community

**NCEAS has a few weekly events that will help you get to know the community and how we work.**

-   **Coffee Klatch:** On Tuesdays at 10:30am, the NCEAS community gathers for Coffee Klatch in the NCEAS lounge to share announcements, coffee, and a chance to mingle with the whole community. Please keep this regular event in your calendar! Coffee Klatch normally lasts about 15 minutes, with more time for mingling as desired. 

-   **Roundtable:** NCEAS Roundtable research presentations are in the lounge at 11:30am on most Wednesdays. You will receive an email in advance with information about the week's speaker or topic. 

**Slack:** Many NCEAS staff use the platform Slack to communicate with each other about daily tasks, new research, office events, and fun social outings. Please join this community and engage as deeply as you'd like! You can create a Slack account and sign up for different group "channels" here: <https://slack.nceas.ucsb.edu/> (e.g., browse or search to join the #social channel and stay aware of community events or ask your co-workers about after work activities).

**Living in SB:** Your NCEAS colleagues created this website with a plethora of helpful info about living in Santa Barbara and working at NCEAS, e.g. library access, campus info, and more: [https://nceaswelcome.weebly.com](https://nceaswelcome.weebly.com/)

**Diversity:** NCEAS has a Diversity Committee that supports community diversity initiatives and is made up of representatives from the community. Committee appointments are made annually, and we encourage you to participate. Please see the NCEAS [Strategic Plan for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/diversity-inclusion) (DEI) for more on NCEAS' commitment to inclusivity in science. If you have feedback on our DEI initiatives during your time at NCEAS, please feel free to speak to anybody on the Diversity Committee, or share thoughts in [this anonymous form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0007Nr0EgCQS21ZQilxcEisRdh4v0qj3fN8100Ih5bDe2AQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
